# chat-rooms

A plugin for [fxbot](https://fxbot.sh): rooms where several of your bots talk with you, and with each other.

- **Rooms** in the sidebar lists your rooms, each with its bots' avatars. **+** makes one: name it, and pick its bots. The first one leads.
- **Tagging:** in a room, `@` lists its bots and **Everyone**. A pick becomes a chip with the bot's avatar.
- **Who answers:** a message wakes the bots it tags. One that tags no one wakes the lead, or every bot in order, by the room's setting.
- **Handing on:** a reply that tags another bot wakes that bot next. A reply that tags no one ends the round.
- **Limits:**
  - at most 3 bots tagged per reply
  - the room's limit of bot replies to one message, 10 by default: past it, bots stop tagging each other, and the ones already asked still answer
  - **Stop**, which ends the reply being written and drops the rest
- **What a bot is sent:** each bot answers in a session of its own for the room, so a room stays out of the bot's own chat. Each turn it's sent:
  - who it is, and who else is in the room
  - what was said since its last turn, the other bots' words quoted
  - who woke it, and the replies left
- **Skills:** three, `chat-room`, `room-handoff`, and `room-lead`, teach a bot how to work in a room. The room sends `chat-room` with a bot's first turn there, and `room-lead` with the lead's first untagged turn.
- **Edit**, on a room, changes its name, its bots and their order, what an untagged message does, and its replies per message, or deletes it.
- **Order:** drag a room in the sidebar to move it, with a mouse, or with a finger after a moment's hold. On fxbot before 0.7.0, rooms stay in the order they were made.

Add it from **Plugins**, where fxbot's list has it. It runs inside fxbot: read its code there before you add it. Only bots it's on for can be in a room. See [Talk with several bots in a room](https://fxbot.sh/docs/how-to/talk-in-a-room/).

On fxbot 0.4.0, which has neither `fx.chats.cancel` nor `createPortal`:
- **Stop** lets the reply being written finish.
- Chips in the message box show `@Name` without the avatar.

## For other plugins

Since 0.3.0, chat rooms provides, with `fx.provide`, for plugins that name it under `needs`:
- `roomOf(session)`: the room one of its sessions is for, `{ id, name, untagged, replies, members }`, or null
- `rooms()`: every room

The room's header leaves a place, `chat-rooms.room-header`, which a plugin fills with `app.slot`; each part gets `room`. [chat-rooms-computer](../chat-rooms-computer/) uses both. On fxbot 0.4, which has neither, the room works as in 0.2.0.

## Files

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin.json` | Its name, version, and parts |
| `package.json` | What the page is built from, ProseMirror, and `"type": "module"` for the server code |
| `fxbot/server.ts` | Its routes, under `/api/plugins/chat-rooms/`, who answers, the queue and its limits, Stop, and what a bot is sent |
| `fxbot/mentions.ts` | The mention token, `<@bot:id>` or `<@all>`, and `@Name` to token and back. The page and the server share it |
| `fxbot/migrations/` | Its tables, in the schema `plugin_chat_rooms` |
| `fxbot/page.jsx` | The sidebar group, the room screen, and its settings |
| `fxbot/composer.jsx` | The message box: ProseMirror, the `@` list, and chips |
| `fxbot/faces.jsx` | A mention's chip, and a room's bots, stacked |
| `fxbot/page.css` | The box's, the chips', and the stacks' styles, and ProseMirror's |
| `fxbot/page.js` | The page, built |
| `fxbot/page-licenses.txt` | The licenses of the packages `page.js` bundles |
| `skills/` | `chat-room`, `room-handoff`, and `room-lead` |

## Build the page

`page.js` is `page.jsx` bundled with [rolldown](https://rolldown.rs), which comes with fxbot's packages. It's built without comments: ProseMirror's are long, and `page.jsx` keeps the plugin's own. Run these in this folder, in a checkout of fxbot, after changing the page or `package.json`:

```sh
npm install
npx rolldown fxbot/page.jsx --format cjs -e react -e react/jsx-runtime -e @fxbot/app --no-comments --file fxbot/page.js
```

React and `@fxbot/app` stay out of the bundle: the page hands over its own. When the bundled packages change, write `fxbot/page-licenses.txt` again from their `LICENSE` files.
