# permissions

A plugin for [fxbot](https://fxbot.sh): decide what each bot does on its own, and what it asks you about first. Each bot has a mode, a call that needs you shows a card above its message box, and the rules you save make it ask less.

Add it from **Plugins**, where fxbot's list has it. It runs inside fxbot: read its code there before you add it. It needs fxbot 0.6.0 or newer. See [Choose what a bot can do alone](https://fxbot.sh/docs/how-to/choose-what-a-bot-can-do-alone/).

This is a seatbelt, not a wall. A reviewer misses things, and a page can be written to fool one.

## A call

Every tool call passes through `tool.before`, in this order:

| What it finds | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| The bot is on `yolo` | It runs |
| The owner said no to this call in this turn | Blocked |
| 3 no's this turn | Blocked, and the bot is told to stop and say what it wanted |
| A rule allows it | It runs |
| The tool is safe | It runs |
| `ask` | It waits for the card |
| `auto` | It waits for the reviewer, then runs, or waits for the card |

The call waits in place, through `tool.before`'s `wait`, so what the owner approves is exactly what runs. A waiting call holds its turn, so a message from the owner closes the card first.

## The reviewer

One tool-free request, on the bot's own model, or the provider and model picked in **Settings** › **Permissions**. It gets the owner's last 10 messages, the bot's name, the action as JSON, for a turn from a plugin in `trusted`, that turn's text, and the owner's words a plugin's message carried on, as `asked`, such as what they asked the bot whose message the turn works on. Its rules allow everyday work, such as reading, editing files, builds, tests, installs, starting services, and messaging the owner's other bots, whether or not the owner asked for that step. They flag what's risky unless the owner plainly asked for it: deleting or overwriting what can't be put back, changing something outside the bot's own computer, secrets, weaker security, and spending money. It gets no tool results, no other bot's words, and no chat, so what attacked the bot can't reach it, except through the action itself.

Only a clean `allow` runs a call. A flag, an error, a timeout, an answer that isn't JSON, or an action over 16 KiB shows a card. An identical call in a turn pays once.

## Who's there

A turn with no `from` on `turn.start` is the owner's, and its card waits. Any other is background, and its card expires after `expires` minutes: the call fails, and the model hears that this isn't a no. A turn the plugin doesn't know, after a restart, is background.

A card closes when the owner writes in that chat, when the turn ends, or when the bot's mode changes. After a restart, a call marked `idempotent` runs again and finds its card. Any other gets libfx's failed result, and `turn.end` closes its card.

## Rules

**Always allow** saves one for that bot. A tool in `exact` gets a rule for that exact input, and any other gets a rule for the whole tool. A rule can't be written by hand, and a bot can't write one: the plugin gives bots no tools.

## Settings

| Setting | What it is | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | A bot's mode until you set one: ask, auto, or yolo | `auto` |
| `seconds` | The most seconds a review takes, 5 to 300 | `60` |
| `expires` | The minutes a background card waits, 1 to 1,440 | `30` |
| `trusted` | Plugins whose turn text counts as the owner's words | `routines` |
| `exact` | Tools whose rules are the exact action | `computer_shell, computer_terminal, computer_desktop` |

A value outside its range means its default, with a line in the plugin's log.

## Tables

In the plugin's own schema, `plugin_permissions`, from `fxbot/migrations/0001_permissions.sql`:
- `modes`: each bot's mode, when it has its own
- `rules`: what **Always allow** saved
- `reviewer`: the provider and model that review, when one is picked
- `asks`: each card, kept 30 days

Removing the plugin drops the schema.

## Cost

- **A tool call:** a read of a map. On `yolo`, a safe tool, or a rule, that's all.
- **A risky call in `auto`:** one model request of about 500 tokens in and 50 out, on each new call, and the seconds it takes.
- **Each bot's requests:** nothing: the plugin adds no tools and no instructions.
- **A card that's open:** a held turn, so one of **Turns at once**, about 5 database commits a second, and about 0.1% of a core, for as long as it waits.
- **Idle:** the page reads `/asks` every 15 seconds, and every 3 while a bot works or a card is open. The server reads the table only while a call waits.
- **Storage:** 30 days of cards.

## Files

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin.json` | Its name, its parts, and its settings |
| `fxbot/server.ts` | The decision, cards, the reviewer, rules, and the routes |
| `fxbot/migrations/0001_permissions.sql` | Its four tables |
| `fxbot/page.jsx` | The card, the mode, the sidebar group, a bot's section, and the reviewer |
| `fxbot/page.js` | `page.jsx`, built |
| `package.json` | `"type": "module"`, for the server code |

Build `page.js` from this folder with:

```sh
npx rolldown fxbot/page.jsx --format cjs -e react -e react/jsx-runtime -e @fxbot/app --file fxbot/page.js
```
