`/fresh`, from the fresh plugin, starts a bot's chat over toward what you write next. The bot summarizes the chat so far, keeping what bears on your words, and your message starts the new chat. Use it when a chat has drifted, or when you want the bot's full attention on something new without losing what it knows about you.

1. Add **fresh** from **Plugins**, on **Browse**, where fxbot's picks list it. It needs fxbot 0.5.0 or newer.
2. In a bot's chat, type `/fresh` and where you want to go, such as `/fresh let's plan the Lisbon trip`. Typing `/` lists it with the bot's skills.
3. Send it. The bot's model writes the summary, which takes as long as a reply, and the message shows **Thinking…** meanwhile.

The chat then shows a **Started over** card, which opens to the summary, then your message without `/fresh`, and the bot's answer. The old chat stays above the card, and the bot finds what was said there with `chat_history`. Every page open on the bot follows to the new chat.

## What the summary keeps

- who you are, and the preferences and rules you set, each rule in your own words
- the facts, decisions, and open tasks that bear on what you wrote, with exact names, numbers, dates, paths, and links
- what was done, apart from what was only suggested

It leaves out the threads that don't bear on your words, in at most 600 words. `/fresh` alone starts over with what still matters, and sends nothing. The plugin's [README](https://github.com/iammrduncan/fxbot/tree/main/plugins/fresh) has the whole request.

## When it doesn't start over

- **A chat with no messages yet:** your words go to it as they are.
- **A room, or any plugin's chat:** `/fresh` is ordinary text there.
- **Without the plugin, or on a bot it's off for:** `/fresh` is sent as typed.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not sent: The chat could not be summarized".** The bot's provider didn't answer the summary, within 2 minutes at most. Nothing moved: choose **Retry** once the provider answers.
- **A long wait.** The summary is one request to the bot's model, over the whole chat. A reverse proxy in front of fxbot must allow a request that long, as a provider switch already needs.
