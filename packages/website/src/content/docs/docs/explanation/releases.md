fxbot gives people a version to stay on, while its owner keeps working on the next one. This page is about how releases are made, how an install moves between them, and why the database only moves forward.

## A release is a merge into main

One version covers the whole repository. Work happens on a branch named for the next release, and `npm run dev` runs from it. When it is ready, it merges into `main`, which holds releases, and updates to the site between them.

The release workflow runs on `main`. When the version in `package.json` has no tag yet, it typechecks and builds, checks that no shipped migration changed, and builds fxbot's image for amd64 and arm64 and pushes it to ghcr.io. Only then does it tag the version and publish the release, with its notes from `docs/releases/`. No tag points at a build that failed, and Settings never offers a release without an image.

The [changelog](/docs/reference/changelog/) and each release's notes are written by hand: the changelog in full, and the notes as a short post, for GitHub, Settings, and anywhere else. A release that adds migrations, bumps libfx, or needs a step by hand opens its changelog section with **Before upgrading**, and its notes say so above their list of changes, so Settings shows it before anything else.

## Installs stay where they are

An install stays on its release until someone chooses the next one. fx, which fxbot takes after, updates itself by default. fxbot doesn't: you update when you are ready. Once a day, the server asks GitHub for the newest release, and **Settings** › **About** shows its notes and an **Update** button. `FXBOT_UPDATE_CHECK=off` stops the asking. Prereleases install only by name, so nobody lands on one by accident.

## Plugins move on their own

A plugin isn't part of a release. fxbot checks each one's repository every hour, and offers an update when its files change, whatever release the install runs. fxbot's own plugins live in fxbot's repository, so they change as soon as its `main` does, often before an install has updated fxbot itself.

So each plugin with code says the oldest fxbot it runs on, as `minFxbot` in its `plugin.json`. An older install shows **Needs fxbot** for a version it can't run, and keeps the one it has. The other way round, when a release breaks something plugins use, fxbot.sh lists it in `plugin-breaks.json`, and a plugin it would break stops as **Unsupported**, rather than breaking a bot halfway through a turn. Its files, settings, and tables stay until a version that fits arrives. Since 0.7.0.

## An image per release

An install runs three containers, from the release's compose file: the app, from fxbot's image for that version, its database, from pgvector's Postgres image, and the local embedder for memory search, from llama.cpp's server image, unless it's turned off. Every machine then runs the same Node, the same Postgres, and pgvector, whatever its distro ships. `/opt/fxbot/.env` names the version that runs.

The app doesn't start containers itself, and has no podman or docker socket. **Update**, in Settings › About, writes a request into a folder the app shares with the machine. systemd sees it and runs the machine's `fxbot` command, as root, which takes only a version from the request. The command downloads the release's compose file and itself, pulls the images it doesn't have yet, writes the new version, and recreates the app's container. Running chats get up to 90 seconds to finish, the database keeps running, and the app is down for a few seconds. The command writes each step to a status file, which Settings shows, and the page reloads onto the new version once it answers.

Nothing changes until the new release has downloaded, so a failed download leaves fxbot as it was. If the new app isn't healthy within 5 minutes, the command goes back to the release it replaced by itself, restoring the backup the new app took before its migrations, if it ran any. Settings then shows why, from the new app's last log lines. [Going back](/docs/how-to/go-back/) by hand later works the same way.

## Migrations

Each release's database changes are numbered SQL files, which ship with the release and never change after it. A starting server runs the ones its database hasn't, in one transaction, under a lock: all of them or none. The chats' tables are the exception: they belong to Workflow's Postgres World, which fxbot pins to one version, and its own setup migrates them when a release moves that version.

They only move forward. Writing a way back for every change would double the work and rarely be tried, so fxbot takes a copy instead. Before any migration runs on a database in use, the server backs up the database and the data folder, whatever started it, and keeps the last five. In a release, `pg_dump` runs in the app's container, whose image carries Postgres 17's client. An older release refuses a database that a newer one migrated, so going back across a migration means restoring that copy.

## Built from the tag

A release's image is built by the release workflow from the commit its tag points at, with the packages in the lockfile. Compose names the exact version of each image, such as `0.3.0`, not `latest`. `setup.sh` and `fxbot update` take the compose file and the `fxbot` command from the release's tag.

Chats are libfx's sessions, so a release that bumps libfx, or the Postgres World that keeps them, says so under **Before upgrading**.
